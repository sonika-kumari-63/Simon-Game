# Simon Game — README
## Project Overview
This project is a **Simon Game Clone** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**. The game follows the classic memory pattern game where the system generates a sequence of colors, and the player must repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level.

The project is beginner-friendly and great for practicing **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **audio integration**, and **game logic implementation** using JavaScript.

##  Features
### Interactive Gameplay
* The game highlights colors in a sequence.
* The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons.
* Each level adds one more step to the pattern.

###  Sound Effects
Each button has a dedicated sound file:
* red.mp3
* blue.mp3
* green.mp3
* yellow.mp3
* wrong.mp3 (for mistakes)

### Visual Feedback
* Button press animation
* Flash animation during sequence generation
* Red screen flash on wrong input

###  Keyboard Start
The game only starts when the user presses any keyboard key.

###  Automatic Restart
If the user makes a mistake, a restart prompt appears.

## Code Breakdown
### **1. index.html**
Contains the layout and structure:
* Title header (`Press A Key to Start`)
* 4 colored buttons arranged in a grid (green, red, yellow, blue)
* Links to CSS, Google Fonts, jQuery, and the main script

### **2. styles.css**
Includes styling for:

* Page background and title
* Button colors and shapes
* Gameplay animations (**pressed**, **game-over**)
* Layout alignment

### **3. game.js**
Handles all game logic:

#### Key Variables
* **buttonColours** — the array of available colors
* **gamePattern** — stores the sequence generated by the game
* **userClickedPattern** — stores user’s button clicks
* **level** — current level number
* **started** — flag to detect if game has started

#### Event Listeners
* **keypress** → starts the game
* **button `click`** → tracks user input

#### Core Functions
##### nextSequence()
* Generates next color
* Updates the level display
* Animates the chosen color
* Plays corresponding sound

##### checkAnswer(currentLevel)
* Compares user input with the game sequence
* If correct: continues to next level
* If incorrect: plays "wrong" sound, flashes screen, and restarts game

##### animatePress(color)
Adds visual press animation to the selected color.

##### playSound(name)
Plays corresponding audio file.

##### startOver()
Resets the game variables so the user can restart.

## How to Play
1. Press any key to begin.
2. Watch the system highlight a color.
3. Click the same color.
4. Each level adds one more color to the pattern.
5. Continue repeating the full sequence.
6. If you click the wrong color — game over!
7. Press any key again to restart.

##  Technologies Used
* **HTML5** — structure
* **CSS3** — layout and animations
* **JavaScript (ES6)** — game logic
* **jQuery** — DOM manipulation & animations

## Customization Options
You can modify or extend the game by:
* Changing button shapes or colors
* Adding a score counter
* Adding difficulty modes (faster sequences)
* Using vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery
* Adding mobile touch support

##  Conclusion
This Simon Game clone is an excellent project to strengthen your JavaScript fundamentals, especially regarding arrays, functions, event listeners, timeouts, and simple game logic.
